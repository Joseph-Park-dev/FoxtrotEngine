Move Semantics
Handing over the memory possession across the variables

Syntax vs. semantics


1) value semantics (copy semantics)
2) reference semantics (pointer)
3) move semantics (move)


int x = 5;
x is a l-value
while 5 is a r-value

l-value possess a memory space
r-value is destroyed after the sentence is finished

int y = GetResult();

GetResult()'s return value is copied into l value y
int& x = GetResult(); throws an error for the reutrn value of the function
is R value and thus cannot have reference

std::move() -> returns RValue from LValue input
